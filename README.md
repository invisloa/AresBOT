This is one of the first projects that started my journey with programming.

I'm aware, that it contains a lot of bad practices.
But I started it as a complete beginner and developed it in parallel with my learning 
+ the flaws that it has help me to understand why good practices are so important.
I'm facing alot of problems, because of things i made bad before.
Some I refactor from time to time, but many of them would require too much time and effort so I leave them as they are- as long as they work as intended :)


I constantly add new features trying to implement my newly learned skills and some good programming principles and practices :)
