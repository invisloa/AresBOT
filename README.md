This project marked the beginning of my journey with programming.

I'm aware that it contains many bad practices, as I started it as a complete beginner and developed it alongside my learning process.

The flaws within the project have helped me understand the importance of good practices. I've encountered numerous problems due to earlier mistakes. Some issues have been refactored over time, but many would require significant time and effort, so I've left them as they are, as long as they function as intended. I continue to add new features, incorporating newly learned skills and adhering to good programming principles and practices.
